I am providing you with English statements or questions along with their answer choices.

Your task is to transform the given English statements into similar code-switched Hinglish sentences, ensuring a balanced mix of Hindi and English phrases and words in each sentence, following the style and script requirements of the examples provided.

Instructions:

Understand the Context and Style: Review the English statements/questions along with the code-switched examples to fully grasp the context, linguistic style, and script requirements. Notice the use of English predominantly while Hindi is mixed within the same sentence in the examples.

Transform into Balanced Hinglish with Specific Proportions Favoring English: Convert the English statements into Hinglish, aiming for a blend where each sentence is primarily in English, with approximately 65% English and 35% Hindi components. Use Devanagari script for the Hindi components and retain the English script for English words. The mix should predominantly favor English but also smoothly integrate Hindi components within each sentence. Make sure there is a good proportion of Hindi in each question.

Maintain Clarity and Accuracy: While code-switching and using different scripts for Hindi and English components, ensure the sentences remain clear, grammatically coherent, and true to the norms of Hinglish. The intent and information in the original English statements should be accurately preserved.
