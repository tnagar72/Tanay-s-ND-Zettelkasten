I am providing you with English statements or questions along with their answer choices. Additionally, I will provide examples of code-switched sentences in Hinglish (a mix of Hindi and English) that incorporate Hindi words in Devanagari script and English words in English script. Your task is to transform the given English statements into similar code-switched Hinglish sentences, ensuring a balanced mix of Hindi and English phrases and words in each sentence, following the style and script requirements of the examples provided.

### Instructions:

1. **Understand the Context and Style**: Review the English statements/questions along with the code-switched examples to fully grasp the context, linguistic style, and script requirements. Code-switching refers to the practice of alternating between two languages within a single conversation or sentence. Notice how the provided examples use English predominantly, while seamlessly integrating Hindi phrases or words within the same sentence.
    
2. **Transform into Balanced Hinglish**: Convert the English statements into Hinglish, aiming for a blend where each sentence is primarily in English, with approximately 65% English and 35% Hindi components. Use Devanagari script for the Hindi components and retain the English script for English words. Ensure a smooth and natural integration of Hindi within the English sentences.
    
3. **Maintain Clarity and Accuracy**: While code-switching and using different scripts for Hindi and English components, ensure the sentences remain clear, grammatically coherent, and true to the norms of Hinglish. Preserve the original meaning and intent of the English statements.
    
4. **Check for Consistency**: Ensure that the style, level of code-switching, and script usage are consistent across all transformed sentences, reflecting the balanced style demonstrated in the examples provided.
