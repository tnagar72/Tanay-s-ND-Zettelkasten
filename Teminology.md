# Terminology

`Coordinate Bilingualism`: A person learns two languages in separate contexts (e.g., one at home, the other at school) and keeps them distinct in their mind, resulting in two independent language systems.

`Subordinate Bilingualism`: A person learns a second language through the lens of their first language, relying on translation and often experiencing interference from their primary language.
